## 1.)  Project Overview

This project is a data analysis initiative aimed at understanding whats predicts student educational performance.

Our goal is to move from observation to data-driven insight, which in turn will help relevant stakeholders focus their resources where they can have the maximum impact on student achievement.

### About This Dataset

Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alizabrand/school-performance-analysis/data

This dataset contains information about students’ academic performance and related demographic factors. It includes scores in math, reading, and writing exams, along with background details such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course.

## The Core Question

What is the best single predictor of a student's final educational performance across core subjects, including Maths, Reading, and English?

By answering this, we aim to establish a strong, measurable relationship between student attributes and academic outcomes.

## Project Scope & Deliverables

Our work is structured into the following phases to ensure a comprehensive analysis:

**1. Foundation** | Defining the business problem and reviewing the structure and quality of the raw data.


**2. Preparation** | Thorough cleaning, wrangling, and transforming the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.


**3. Discovery** | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualise relationships and patterns within the dataset.


**4. Modeling** | Developing analytical models (e.g., predictive models) to determine the strength of various factors in predicting performance.


**5. Reporting** | Interpreting the results to provide clear insights into the most influential predictors.


**6. Presentation** | Summarising our methodology, findings, and recommendations for stakeholders.
